# Jarn Nai: Who's That Instructor?

## A fun little project to help solve the age-old Chula question: "Jarn Khon Nee Pen Krai Wa?"

This is a simple, user-friendly web app for students (and maybe alumni) at the Computer Engineering Department, Chulalongkorn University (CP CU). You can search for instructors by their abbreviations and, if they're not found, contribute by adding them to the database.

For backend, I want to scraping web to get Jarn data but it's so very very hard (for deploy and setup step). So I scrape and save in database (it's a little bit cursed but hey, it works!)
